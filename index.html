      <p>Between growing up with small business owners and being an alumni of my local community college back in Washington State, I feel extremely close to the issues Plum aims to address.

      <h3>Kristin Cambriello, MAIOP</h3>
      <p>I struggled with deciding which field I wanted to enter into. I had no experience in any potential field, so it was hard to make that decision without knowing what each option was like. I wish I had Plum to aid me in this decision. My goal is to find those students and help match them with their potential fields within their community.</p>
